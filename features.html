            </header>
            <p> I am Haseeb, and my passion for design and creativity was instilled in me by my father, Zakaullah. In the summer of 2023, during a school vacation, I embarked on a fascinating learning adventure. My initial exposure came from an office environment, where I absorbed knowledge and skills related to my passions - interior design, architecture, and 3D modeling.

            As I delved deeper into these fields, I discovered the power of visualization and design to shape spaces and environments. The ability to transform ideas into tangible, beautiful spaces captivated my imagination.
            
            Inspired by this newfound passion, I decided to share my creative journey with the world. I aim to inspire and educate others on the magic of design, providing insights, tips, and a glimpse into the fascinating world of interior design, architecture, and 3D modeling. This journey is not just a career path for me but a creative exploration driven by a genuine love for shaping spaces and creating captivating visual experiences.</p>

            <p>The first time I encountered the AutoCAD interface, it appeared daunting and challenging. It was a world of intricate designs and technicalities that seemed almost impenetrable. However, as I delved deeper and started to explore its intricacies, I began to realize the immense potential that lay within this software.

                Much of my journey into AutoCAD and my subsequent improvement can be attributed to my father. His unwavering support and guidance played a pivotal role in sparking my interest in this field. He not only introduced me to the world of AutoCAD but also nurtured my curiosity and provided me with the necessary tools to thrive in it. Thanks to my dad's encouragement and belief in my abilities, I not only conquered the initial challenges but also developed a genuine passion for this craft. It's a testament to the power of mentorship and a reminder of the incredible impact that a parent's support can have on a child's journey of growth and learning.</p>

            <h2>When does design come in handy?</h2>
            <p>While it might seem like extra work at a first glance, here are some key moments in which prototyping
                will come in handy:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Usability testing</strong>. Does your user know how to exit out of screens? Can they
                    follow your intended user journey and buy something from the site you’ve designed? By running a
                    usability test, you’ll be able to see how users will interact with your design once it’s live;
                </li>
                <li><strong>Involving stakeholders</strong>. Need to check if your GDPR consent boxes are displaying
                    properly? Pass your prototype to your data protection team and they can test it for real;</li>
                <li><strong>Impressing a client</strong>. Prototypes can help explain or even sell your idea by
                    providing your client with a hands-on experience;</li>
                <li><strong>Communicating your vision</strong>. By using an interactive medium to preview and test
                    design elements, designers and developers can understand each other — and the project — better.
                </li>
            </ol>
